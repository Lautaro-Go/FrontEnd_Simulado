# FrontEnd_Simulado
Numerical Methods Frontend (React + Plotly + Tailwind)  This project is a React-based frontend for a numerical root-finding simulator. It connects to a FastAPI backend to compute iterative methods (Newton-Raphson, Fixed Point, and Aitken acceleration) and displays the results with a modern and responsive UI.
