Numerical Methods Frontend (React + Plotly + Tailwind)

This project is a React-based frontend for a numerical root-finding simulator. It connects to a FastAPI backend to compute iterative methods (Newton-Raphson, Fixed Point, and Aitken acceleration) and displays the results with a modern and responsive UI.

‚ú® Features

Interactive form to configure the method (equations, initial guess, tolerance, iterations).

Real-time plots of f(x) and/or g(x) using Plotly.

Visualization of iteration points and root approximation.

Dynamic results table showing iteration history with errors.

Responsive layout with TailwindCSS (form on the left, plot on the right, table below).

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

React 19 with Vite

Plotly.js + react-plotly.js for interactive graphs

Axios for API requests

TailwindCSS for styling

üöÄ Usage

Run the backend (FastAPI) on port 8000.
